# Cowire

**Cowire** is an MCP-native broker that sits between cooperating agents (Co, CC) and user channels. The broker process is called **Switch** — an MCP server that holds the event queue and decision state. Co and CC connect to Switch as MCP clients; future agents plug in by speaking MCP.

This repo is the reference implementation of Switch.

## Status

Phase A + B (MVP):
- Event emission, subscription, replay
- `await_decision` / `respond_to_decision` with timeout fallback
- Persistence in SQLite (`~/.cowire/cowire.db`)
- Two transports on one process: stdio (for CC) and HTTP/SSE (for Cowork dashboards, webhook receivers)

Spec 40 Phase 1 — daemon foundation:
- `cowire daemon start/stop/status/restart` — long-running Switch on `127.0.0.1:7777`
- Survives client disconnects; concurrent SSE clients share one Broker + SQLite store
- PID file at `~/.cowire/daemon.pid`, stale-PID detection, atomic writes
- `cowire connect-test` smoke command

See `..\privacy tracker\specs\37_cowork-cc-event-bridge.md` for the architecture.

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Daemon mode (recommended)

`cowire daemon` is a long-running Switch process bound to `127.0.0.1:7777`. It survives MCP client disconnects, accepts concurrent SSE clients (one Co + N CCs), and shares a single SQLite store across all of them. This is the foundation for the v0.2 Co-orchestrates-N-CCs architecture (spec 40).

```powershell
# foreground (logs to stderr; Ctrl-C to stop)
npx cowire daemon start --port 7777

# detached (returns immediately with the PID)
npx cowire daemon start --port 7777 --detach

# inspect
npx cowire daemon status
# { "running": true, "pid": 12345, "port": 7777, "uptime_sec": 42,
#   "connected_clients": 1, "event_count": 17, "pending_decisions": 0 }

# graceful stop (SIGTERM, falls back to SIGKILL after 10s)
npx cowire daemon stop

# restart with the same port/db as the previous run
npx cowire daemon restart
```

PID file at `~/.cowire/daemon.pid` (JSON: `pid`, `port`, `started_at`, `db`). A stale PID file (process dead) is detected and overwritten automatically; a live PID requires `--force` to override.

### Connect Cowork to the daemon

In Cowork's `claude_desktop_config.json`, replace the spawn entry with a remote SSE entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "switch": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### If your MCP client doesn't support `type: "sse"`

Some MCP clients (e.g. current Cowork builds) silently ignore `type: "sse"` entries in their MCP config. For those, point the client at the **shim** instead — a small stdio↔SSE proxy that speaks stdio to the client and SSE to the daemon:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "switch": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\you\\path\\to\\cowire\\dist\\shim.js"],
      "env": { "COWIRE_DAEMON_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp/sse" }
    }
  }
}
```

The shim (`src/shim.ts` → `dist/shim.js`) is a byte-level forwarder: it does not parse messages, it just relays JSON-RPC between the two transports. From the client's perspective it's a normal stdio MCP server; from the daemon's perspective it's a normal SSE client. Cowork ends up talking to the same daemon as future CC sessions — shared event log, shared decision queue.

You can also run it interactively for ad-hoc testing:

```powershell
npx cowire shim --url http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp/sse
```

### Smoke test

```powershell
# terminal 1
npx cowire daemon start --port 7777

# terminal 2
npx cowire daemon status
npx cowire connect-test
# { "ok": true, "connected_to": "...", "emitted_event_id": "...",
#   "subscribed_kinds": ["*"], "received_count": 1, "received_kinds": ["progress"] }
```

### Troubleshooting

- **`daemon already running (pid ...)`** — another daemon owns the PID file. Either `cowire daemon stop` or `cowire daemon start --force`.
- **Port in use but no PID file** — another process owns `:7777`. `netstat -ano | findstr 7777` to find it, or pick a different `--port`.
- **Client can't connect** — the daemon binds `127.0.0.1` explicitly. Use that literal host (not `localhost`, which may resolve to IPv6 `::1` first on Windows).
- **Stale PID file** — if the daemon was killed forcibly, the PID file is left behind. `cowire daemon start` detects a dead PID and overwrites; if you see a "stale PID file" warning, that's expected.

## stdio mode (legacy / per-spawn)

```bash
# both transports (default)
npx cowire start --port=7777

# stdio only (for embedding under CC)
npx cowire start --stdio-only
```

CLI:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `cowire daemon start [--port=7777] [--db PATH] [--detach] [--force]` | Start the long-running daemon. |
| `cowire daemon stop` | Send SIGTERM (fallback SIGKILL after 10s). |
| `cowire daemon status` | Print running state, port, uptime, client/event counts. |
| `cowire daemon restart` | Restart with previous port/db. |
| `cowire connect-test [--url URL]` | Smoke test: connect via SSE, emit one event, print what came back. |
| `cowire shim [--url URL]` | Stdio↔SSE proxy — for MCP clients that don't accept `type: "sse"`. |
| `cowire start [--port=7777] [--stdio-only]` | Per-spawn stdio (+optional HTTP) — legacy / dev-only. |
| `cowire status` | DB stats and recent decisions. |
| `cowire events [--kind=K] [--since=ISO] [--limit=N]` | Query the event log. |

## Connect from CC (stdio)

Add Switch as a stdio MCP server in CC's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cowire": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["cowire", "start", "--stdio-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Raw HTTP/SSE endpoints (daemon)

```
GET  http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp/sse        # open SSE stream
POST http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp/messages   # send messages back
GET  http://127.0.0.1:7777/healthz        # liveness
GET  http://127.0.0.1:7777/status         # live counts (sse_sessions, events, pending_decisions)
```

## Tools registered

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `emit_event` | Fire-and-forget event publish (Pattern C). |
| `subscribe_to_events` | Register a session for notifications (Pattern B). |
| `unsubscribe` | Remove subscription. |
| `get_events` | Query historical events. |
| `await_decision` | Block until response (Pattern A). 30-min cap. |
| `respond_to_decision` | Resolve a pending decision. |

## GitHub adapter

Switch exposes **14 read-only tools + 10 write tools** backed by the `gh` CLI on the host machine. Requires `gh auth login` to have been run; the tools inherit the authenticated user's permissions.

### Read-only (always safe)

`github.read_pr`, `github.list_prs`, `github.read_issue`, `github.list_issues`, `github.read_commit`, `github.list_commits`, `github.read_file`, `github.list_workflow_runs`, `github.read_workflow_run`, `github.read_pr_diff`, `github.list_pr_files`, `github.read_pr_review_comments`, `github.list_labels`, `github.list_branches`.

### Write actions (gated by `await_decision`)

Every write call opens a `decision_request` first. A human approves via Cowork (or any other MCP client that calls `respond_to_decision`); the underlying `gh` invocation only runs on approve. On reject or timeout the tool returns `{ ok: false, reason: 'rejected_by_user' }` and emits no success event. See [ADR-008](./adr/008-write-actions-await-decision.md).

| Tool | Tier | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `github.create_pr` | confirm | Open a PR (`--head` → `--base`, body via stdin, optional `--draft`). |
| `github.merge_pr` | confirm | Squash-merge + delete branch. |
| `github.create_issue` | confirm | Open an issue with optional labels. |
| `github.create_issue_comment` | confirm | Post a comment on an issue. |
| `github.create_pr_comment` | confirm | Post a comment on a PR. |
| `github.close_issue` | confirm | Close an issue (optional closing comment). |
| `github.reopen_issue` | confirm | Reopen a closed issue. |
| `github.add_labels` | confirm | Add labels to an issue or PR. |
| `github.remove_labels` | confirm | Remove labels from an issue or PR. |
| `github.request_pr_review` | confirm | Request review from one or more reviewers. |

What is **NEVER tier** and stays manual: force-push, branch delete, `merge_pr --force`, repo-settings changes. See [ADR-018](./adr/018-destructive-operations-stay-manual.md).

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Run the full local gate (the same checks CI runs):

```bash
npm run check
```

## CI

GitHub Actions runs `tsc --noEmit` + `vitest run` + `npm run build` on every push to `main` and every PR. See [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

Recommended branch protection: require the **Build and test** check on `main`. Configure via Settings → Branches → Add rule (require status checks to pass, require branches to be up to date before merging, disallow force-push and deletion).

## License

TBD — keeping mainstream-deps so this could be opened later.
